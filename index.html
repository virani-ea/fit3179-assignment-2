      <p>
        <strong>Are hospitals located where people live? How do socioeconomic factors influence healthcare equity?</strong><br><br>
        This visualisation explores healthcare access across Victoria, starting with a statewide overview and then zooming in <br>
        to highlight regional equity and disparities. The interactive maps and charts reveal how hospital locations, <br>
        population, and socioeconomic factors shape access. Designed for policymakers and the public.

            It is evident that the majority of hospitals are positioned <br>
            in or near high-density regions, <strong>supporting health service <br>
            accessibility in populous urban zones</strong>.<br><br>
            However, the map also reveals <strong>large, low-density areas with few <br>
            or no hospitals</strong>, raising questions about healthcare access for <br>
            rural communities. <br><br>
            These spatial insights prompt further investigation into service <br>
            availability and equity outside major cities.

        <h3>How does Victoria compare to other states?</h3>
        <div class="flex-column">
          <div id="vis2"></div>
          <p>This chart compares Australian states and territories by the number <br> 
            of public hospitals per 100,000 residents—a basic indicator of <br>
            potential healthcare access. <br><br>

            While densely populated regions like NSW and Victoria have the <br>
            highest absolute numbers of hospitals, <strong>smaller states (i.e. <br> 
            Tasmania and South Australia) have more hospitals per <br>capita</strong>, suggesting strong access. <br><br>

            ACT stands out for its uniquely low ratio, largely due to its <br>
            city-state structure. This perspective highlights regional <br>
            inequalities in infrastructure, which can have implications for <br>healthcare delivery and resilience.

            <p>The following plot displays ambulance response times for <br>
              Victorian LGAs by SEIFA decile. Each box shows the range, <br> 
              spread, and median of response times within a decile. <br>
              Comparing boxes across deciles highlights differences  <br> 
              between disadvantaged and advantaged areas.

        <div class="flex-column-center">
          <p>This chart explores how socioeconomic disadvantage correlates <br> 
            with ambulance response times across Victoria. <br><br>

            A clear pattern emerges — <strong>response times tend to be longer <br>
              in more disadvantaged regions</strong>, with greater variability as well. <br>
              This suggests that residents in lower-decile LGAs may face slower <br>
              emergency response due to factors such as lower service density, <br>
              resource constraints, or distance from urban centers.<br><br>

            By contrast, <strong>wealthier and more urban LGAs (higher deciles)</strong> <br>
            generally report faster and more consistent response times, <br>
            highlighting disparities in emergency care accessibility. These <br>findings reinforce the broader theme of <strong>unequal healthcare <br>
            access</strong> and underscore the importance of equitable resource<br>
            distribution across Victoria’s regions.

            <p><strong>How to Read This Chart</strong></p>
            <p>
            This scatter plot summarises hospital density (hospitals/square <br>
            kilometre) for Victorian LGAs grouped by SEIFA decile. Each <br>
            point summarises hospital density within a specific <br> 
            socioeconomic decile. The y-axis represents relative advantage <br> 
            (higher decile = more advantage), and the x-axis shows<br>
            hospital density. Comparing these helps identify patterns or <br>
            differences in hospital accessibility across socioeconomic groups.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex-column-center">
          <p>
            <strong>How Strongly Does Disadvantage Affect Hospital Accessibility?</strong><br>
            The plot shows that higher SEIFA decile areas do not <br>
            always correspond to greater hospital density; there are <br>
            several affluent LGAs with low density. <br><br>
            However, as decile increases, there is more variation in <br>
            hospital density: decile 2 LGAs consistently have very low hospital <br>
            density (below 0.05), while deciles 7 and above show some LGAs <br>
            with substantially higher densities. <br><br>
            Thus, though the relationship between geographic advantage and <br>
            hospital access may be inconsistent, geographic factors remain an important influence.
