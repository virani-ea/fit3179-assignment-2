        <div> It is evident that the majority of hospitals are 
          positioned in or near high-density regions, supporting
          health service accessibility in populous urban zones.
          However, the map also reveals large, low-density areas
          with few or no hospitals, raising questions about healthcare
          access for rural communities. These spatial insights prompt
          further investigation into service availability and equity
          outside major cities. </div>

        <p>
          The distribution of disadvantage varies across Victoria, seen in both metro and rural LGAs.
          Cross-referencing with hospital locations can reveal mismatches between need and access.<br>
          <strong>Are the most disadvantaged areas those with least hospital proximity?<br></strong><br>
          Click on decile values to explore regions by socioeconomic score.<br>
          Score 1 means most disadvantaged, while score 10 means least disadvantaged.<br>
