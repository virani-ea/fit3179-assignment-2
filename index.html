        <div id="vis1"></div>
        <div> It is evident that the majority of hospitals are 
          positioned in or near high-density regions, supporting
          health service accessibility in populous urban zones.
          However, the map also reveals large, low-density areas
          with few or no hospitals, raising questions about healthcare
          access for rural communities. These spatial insights prompt
          further investigation into service availability and equity
          outside major cities. </div>

    <!-- Visualisation 2: Hospital Counts by State -->

      <h2>2. How does Victoria compare to other states?</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div id="vis2"></div>
        <div>This chart compares Australian states and territories by the number of public hospitals per 100,000 residents—a basic indicator of potential healthcare access. <br><br>
          While densely populated regions like NSW and Victoria have the 
          highest absolute numbers of hospitals, smaller states (such as Tasmania and South Australia) have more hospitals per capita, improving local access. <br><br>
          ACT stands out for its uniquely low ratio, largely due to its city-state structure. This perspective highlights regional inequalities in infrastructure, which can have implications for healthcare delivery and resilience.

          The distribution of disadvantage varies across Victoria, seen in both metro and rural LGAs.
          Cross-referencing with hospital locations can reveal mismatches between need and access.<br>
          <strong>Are the most disadvantaged areas those with least hospital proximity?<br></strong><br>
          Click on decile values to explore regions by socioeconomic score.<br>
          Score 1 means most disadvantaged, while score 10 means least disadvantaged.<br>
