          It is evident that the majority of hospitals are 
          positioned in or near high-density regions, supporting
          health service accessibility in populous urban zones.
          However, the map also reveals large, low-density areas
          with few or no hospitals, raising questions about healthcare
          access for rural communities. These spatial insights prompt
          further investigation into service availability and equity
          outside major cities.

      <h2>2. How does Victoria compare to other states?</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <p>This chart compares Australian states and territories by the number of public hospitals per 100,000 residents—a basic indicator of potential healthcare access. <br><br>
          While densely populated regions like NSW and Victoria have the 
          highest absolute numbers of hospitals, smaller states (such as Tasmania and South Australia) have more hospitals per capita, improving local access. <br><br>
          ACT stands out for its uniquely low ratio, largely due to its city-state structure. This perspective highlights regional inequalities in infrastructure, which can have implications for healthcare delivery and resilience.

                The distribution of disadvantage varies across Victoria, seen in both metro and rural LGAs.
                Cross-referencing with hospital locations can reveal mismatches between need and access.<br>

      <h2>4. Ambulance Response Time by Decile</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div id="vis4"></div>
        <p>This chart explores how socioeconomic disadvantage correlates with ambulance response times across Victoria. <br><br>

          A clear pattern emerges — <strong>response times tend to be longer in more disadvantaged regions</strong>, with greater variability as well. This suggests that residents in lower-decile LGAs may face slower emergency response due to factors such as lower service density, resource constraints, or distance from urban centers.<br><br>

          By contrast, <strong>wealthier and more urban LGAs (higher deciles)</strong> generally report faster and more consistent response times, highlighting disparities in emergency care accessibility.
          These findings reinforce the broader theme of <strong>unequal healthcare access</strong> and underscore the importance of equitable resource distribution across Victoria’s regions.
